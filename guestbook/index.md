Mark for MLK Day's!

* Intelligence plus character – that is the goal of real education.
* In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.
* The meaning of life is to live a full life, not to live long.
* In this world, no one can make you fall, if your own beliefs are still standing.
* Faith is the first step when you can't see the whole staircase.

**If you can't fly, then run; if you can't run, then walk; if you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.**
